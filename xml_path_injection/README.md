# CTFS_SETUP
this is a challenge about xml path injection !
to setup the challenge you will need a webserver , I suggest apache2 for instance or nginx too 
after adding those files to the "/var/www/html" directory , move the creds.xml from it and place some where else , don't forget to change the path on the login script too , the challenge is to retrieve the the flag without reading the creds.xml file !
